🏠 House Price Prediction – Boston Housing Dataset
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts median house prices in the Boston area using socio-economic, structural, and geographic features. The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to develop accurate machine learning models for predicting house values.

🎯 Objective

Predict house prices based on features like crime rate, average number of rooms, socio-economic status, and more 🏘️

Identify key factors that influence housing prices 📊

Build robust models with high predictive accuracy ✅
